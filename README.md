<b>Overview</b>

This project demonstrates how to interact with multiple APIs to retrieve data. It focuses on three APIs: the Random User Generator API, the OpenWeatherMap API, and the NASA Earth Imagery API. Each API serves a specific purpose and highlights various methods of making requests and handling responses.

<b>APIs :</b><br>
    <b>OpenWeatherMap API : </b> This API provides weather information for a given city.
    <b>NASA Earth Imagery API :</b> This API retrieves satellite imagery based on specified geographic coordinates and dates.
    <b>Random User Generator API :</b>This API generates random user data, useful for application testing.
    
<b>Methods Used </b>
   <b> Require:</b> Used to import necessary modules.
   <b>Fetch:</b> Utilized for making requests in a modern, promise-based manner.
   <b> Axios:</b> Leveraged for handling HTTP requests, offering features such as automatic JSON parsing and request cancellation.

<b>Conclusion</b>

This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of how to interact with different APIs using JavaScript, showcasing techniques for making requests, processing responses, and integrating external services into applications
