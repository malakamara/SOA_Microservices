Overview

This project demonstrates how to interact with multiple APIs to retrieve data. It focuses on three APIs: the Random User Generator API, the OpenWeatherMap API, and the NASA Earth Imagery API. Each API serves a specific purpose and highlights various methods of making requests and handling responses.
APIs :
    OpenWeatherMap API
    Description: This API provides weather information for a given city.
    NASA Earth Imagery API
    Description: This API retrieves satellite imagery based on specified geographic coordinates and       dates.
    Random User Generator API
    Description: This API generates random user data, useful for application testing.
Methods Used
    Require: Used to import necessary modules.
    Fetch: Utilized for making requests in a modern, promise-based manner.
    Axios: Leveraged for handling HTTP requests, offering features such as automatic JSON parsing and request cancellation.

Conclusion

This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of how to interact with different APIs using JavaScript, showcasing techniques for making requests, processing responses, and integrating external services into applications
